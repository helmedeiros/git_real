# Great! As you can see, your stash is in the stash list. Let's apply the stash so you can get back to work.

$ git stash apply stash@{0}


# On branch new_feature
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   unicorn.rb
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

Success!
