# Wow, there are so many small fixes on master today! You really need to stash some more changes, but it doesn't seem to be working on these untracked files you just created. Try using the --include-untracked option to stash all those new files.
$ git stash save --include-untracked
Saved working directory and index state WIP on new_feature: b04c9c0 Add unicorn
HEAD is now at b04c9c0 Add unicorn

Success!
